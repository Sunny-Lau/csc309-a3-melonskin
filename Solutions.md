- Explain the features of your web application, the end-user and how s/he might use it.
- Our first view is a simple welcome, plus that the user can use the search bar on the
	top-right corner to allocate the center of near-by searching, and use the drop-downs to
	determine the radius and home type of searching. The default search center is Bahen center.
	The default search radius is 1000m and default home type is condo. The top navigation bar always 
	collapses to a view fitting mobile screen.
- After specifying the parameter of searching, the user will be on the second view. In this
	view, the map shows the locations of places found by google API followed by the place image. If their is
	no place image found on google map api, a default picture will show instead. When clicking at the marker on
	map, screen will automatically scroll to corresponding place holder. Shrinking the screen size will
	lead to a hidden of place image and a decrease in font size. Clicking the top button at the
	bottom-left corner will scroll the screen back to top.
- Clicking the specific location on the side-bar can take the user to the third view. Here
	is the comment and ratings, and users can write their own. In assignment 2, we gives 4 examples of user comment and
	users are able to add comment (must be filled to submit) alongwith their username (can be anynoumous). The newly added comment 
	will be displayed one the review area but not be saved. When shrinking the screen to a smaller size, rating statistics (number of 
	selection) will be hidden. There is a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen which helps users navigate through this detail
	page to make the selected area show on top of the screen. The bottom navigation bar can also collapse when screen size decreases.

- A note if you plan on submitting the assignment late.
